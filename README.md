# meta

The `meta` contract is a simple implementation of a token contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides basic functionality for creating and managing a custom token.

## Token Details

- Token Name: rim
- Token Abbreviation: naz
- Total Supply: 0

## Contract Features

### Balances Mapping

The contract maintains a mapping of addresses to balances, which allows keeping track of the token balance for each address.

```solidity
mapping(address => uint) public balances;
```

### Mint Function

The `mint` function increases the total supply of tokens and adds the specified amount of tokens to the balance of a given address.

```solidity
function mint(address _address, uint _value) public {
    totalSupply += _value;
    balances[_address] += _value;
}
```

### Burn Function

The `burn` function decreases the total supply of tokens and deducts the specified amount of tokens from the balance of a given address.

```solidity
function burn(address _address, uint _value) public {
    totalSupply -= _value;
    balances[_address] -= _value;
}
```

## Usage

1. Deploy the contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Interact with the contract using Ethereum wallets or smart contracts.
3. Use the `mint` function to create new tokens and distribute them to addresses.
4. Use the `burn` function to destroy tokens and reduce the total supply.

## Important Considerations

- This contract is a basic example and lacks important security features and additional functionalities found in standard token contracts.
- Before deploying the contract to the mainnet, it's recommended to conduct thorough testing on Ethereum testnets to ensure its functionality and security.
- Be cautious when handling tokens and ensure proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized actions.

Please note that this contract serves as a simple illustration of token creation and management and should not be used for actual production purposes without further refinement and security enhancements.
